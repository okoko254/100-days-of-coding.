Arrays - linear data structure that stores multiple items
Characteristics of an array
-use an inex-based data structure that helps identify each of the elements
can handle complex data structures by storing data in two-dimensional arrays
used to implement other data structures eg. stacks,queues, heaps, hash tables e.t.c

Operations Persformed on Arrays
Initialisation- can be dones during declaration or after
Accessing elements- using it's index which starts from 0 and goes all the way to arraySize-1
Searching for elements- using linear search or binary search algorithms.
Inserting elements - Elements can be inserted into an array at a specific location, but this operation can be time-consuming becauuse it requires shifting existing elements in the array
Deleting elements- by shifting elements that come after it to fill the gap
Updating elements- by assigning a new value to a specified index
Traversing elements- elements can be traversed in order, visiting each elements once.

Applications of Arrays
An array is used in solving matrix problems.
Database records are also implemented by an array.
It helps in implementing a sorting algorithm.
It is also used to implement other data structures like Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Hash tables, etc.
An array can be used for CPU scheduling.
Can be applied as a lookup table in computers.
Arrays can be used in speech processing where every speech signal is an array.
The screen of the computer is also displayed by an array. Here we use a multidimensional array. 
The array is used in many management systems like a library, students, parliament, etc. 
The array is used in the online ticket booking system. Contacts on a cell phone are displayed by this array. 
In games like online chess, where the player can store his past moves as well as current moves. It indicates a hint of position. 
To save images in a specific dimension in the android Like 360*1200 

Real-Life Applications of Array: 
An array is frequently used to store data for mathematical computations.
It is used in image processing.
It is also used in record management.
Book pages are also real-life examples of an array.
It is used in ordering boxes as well.
