LinkedList is a list where the nodes are linked together, each node contains data and a pointer that points to where in the memory the next node is placed
Benefits
-nodes don't have to be stored contiguously(right next to each other)
-When adding or removing nodes, the rest of the nodes in the list don't have to be shifted.

Characteristics
1st node is called a head and the last node is called a tail

Operations Performed
Initialisation - by creating a head node with a reference to the first node.Each subsequent node contains the value and a refernce of the next node
